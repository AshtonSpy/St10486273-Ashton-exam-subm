this image shows us that the main screen is working correctly, allowing the user to input song and store them, but unfortunately i could not
get the view button to go to the next screen

![detail view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33aeb582-2393-4d16-be32-5a3bc43ce13d)
after clicking the detail button its supposed to take the user to the screen that shows the detail like the average of the songs they entered, but i cant get it to go there without crashing

![song](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4279b5b-06a2-4a86-88f3-7092457894fa)
this picture show the code that would display the user what song they had chosen but again it crashes as i couldnt even get to the button on this page :)
